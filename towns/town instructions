towns are stored in a single json "towns" file.
aside from the data folder, all that is require for the program to generate a town is for there to be a town object in the towns file.
the format for which is the following:
{
    "town1": {},
    "town2": {},
    "town3": {},
    "town4": {}
}

you can replace "town1" "town2" ect with the town's actual name.
